# Hey there\! 👋 I'm Deveesh

**Frontend Dev who can apparently work on any domain** 

Started my journey as a Python programmer, thinking I'd become the next data scientist, and ended up falling in love with web development instead. Now I'm out here building UIs and pretending my Python days never happened.

<br />

## Current Status

- Working at [Levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) - Building Interactive Offers
- Working Remotely 🏖️
- Working with the TNT Stack 💣 - TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- Active member at FOSS United Mangalore, TiE Mangaluru, IEEE Mangalore Subsection, and GDG Cloud Mangalore
- **Fun Fact:** ~I am an early bird.~ ~Now, I am a night owl~. Well, now I am in the middle of both.

<br />

When I'm not debugging someone else's code (probably my own), you'll find me:

- 🏋️ Hitting the gym _(because developers need gains too)_
- 📚 Reading books _(have a look at my [book_collection](https://dev.shetty.dev/books))_
- ✏️ Sketching random stuff _(check out my [art gallery](https://dev.shetty.dev/art-gallery) if you're into that)_
- 🏢 Watching The Office
